======

resync is ResourceSync client and library in python.

Typical client usage to synchronize from a source at http://source.example.com/
to a set of local files in /tmp/my_source_example_com::

    resync http://source.example.com/ /tmp/my_source_example_com

Typical library usage in a source::

    from resync.resource_list import ResourceList
    from resync.resource import Resource

    rl = ResourceList()
    rl.add( Resource('http://example.com/res1', lastmod='2013-01-01') )
    rl.add( Resource('http://example.com/res2', lastmod='2013-01-02') )
    print rl.as_xml(rl)

Installation
------------

The client and library are designed to work with Python 2.6 or 2.7. You may check the version running on your system with::

    python --version

To download and install the reync client and library, which is currently available only from [Github](https://github.com/resync/resync) (not yet on pypi)::

    cd /tmp
    git clone git://github.com/resync/resync.git
    cd resync/
    python setup.py build
    sudo python setup.py install

This will install the library code in the appropriate place within your python setup, and the client (resync) in an appropriate system path (perhaps /usr/local/bin).
